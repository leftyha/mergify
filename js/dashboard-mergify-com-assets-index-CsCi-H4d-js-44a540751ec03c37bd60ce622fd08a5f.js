Running all tests on every PR might be exhaustive and time-consuming. It can
also drain CI resources, especially if the full suite involves comprehensive,
heavy, or time-intensive tests. Instead, separating tests into two distinct
groups can be beneficial:

1. **Preliminary Tests**: These are the tests you run on every PR preliminary
   after they're created or updated, usually encompassing code linters and
   essential unit tests that are faster and critical to ensuring basic
   functionality.

2. **Pre-Merge Tests**: Before merging a pull request, a more comprehensive set
   of tests (including functional tests, integration tests, and perhaps some
   performance tests) are run to ensure robustness. These tests might be
   lengthier and more resource-intensive.
